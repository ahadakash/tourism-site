## About: 

It all began in 1986 when Multiple Sclerosis Limited (MSL) identified the need for high-quality care services for people living with this chronic disease. By 1999, MSL recognised the time had come to establish NanoCare as a separate legal entity. A savvy and experienced Board was appointed and we were firmly on the path to growth. This growth was boosted by a series of acquisitions within the care sector between 2001 and 2008.
